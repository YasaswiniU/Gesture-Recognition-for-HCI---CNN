# Gesture-Recognition-for-HCI---CNN
The objective of the project is to form a way to acknowledge hand gestures, supported by a pattern recognition technique with high speed. High priority for the system is to be simple without making use of any special hardware. All the computation should occur on a PC. It's also to style and develop an application with a gesture-based interface, adaptable to a particular user with recognition of the dynamic gestures supporting the posture of the hand. The system is additionally intended to be able to be resilient from external factors like light, distance and movements. The system should be recognized with high accuracy. The developed system should help interact with a computer with ease.
